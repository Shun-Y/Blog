    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      A Traversable type is a kind of upgraded Foldable. Where Foldable gives you the ability to go through the structure processing the elements (foldr) but throwing away the shape, Traversable allows you to do that whilst preserving the shape and, e.g., putting new values in. Traversable is what we need for mapM and sequence : note the apparently surprising fact that the "_" versions are in a different typeclass.
