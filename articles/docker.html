  <p>
  Recently, Blog entry about constructing web application using Docker Compose can be seen often than before.
  And also "How to dockerize Yesod Application" also can be seen but  
  decompose these application each service (container).
  Recently, I'm interested in how to construct Web(Yesod) Application using Docker Compose.
  I'm currently experimenting in blog application.
  I'd like to share what I'm strugging and want any feedback.
  So, please give me any feedback!
  </p>
  <p>This is the construction of the application that I want to create</p>

    <p>Structure of components</p>

<section>
  <h1>docker-compose.yml</h1>
  <p>
    All you have to do to compose all components for the application is just to write "docker-compose.yml".
    Here is a yml file for my sample application.
    I'd like to describe rules of each line. 
  </p>
  <pre>
    web:
        build: .
        volumes:
          - .:/blog/
        tty: true
        stdin_open: true 
        working_dir: /blog
        ports:
            - "3000:3000"
        command: stack exec -- yesod devel
        environment:
          # - PATH=/root/.local/bin:$PATH
          - HOST=0.0.0.0
          - APPROOT=http://localhost:3000
          - PGUSER=postgres
          - PGPASS
          - PGHOST=postgres
        links:
            - postgres
    postgres:
        image: postgres:latest
        volumes:
          - /var/lib/postgresql
        ports:
          - "5432:5432"
    database:
        image: postgres
        volumes_from:
          - postgres
  </pre>
  <p>
  docker-compose will create one docker container for each service.
  web: 
    build: image of the container 
    volumes: edit files on local system, 
    stdin_open: true  
    working_dir: set where the command run. 
    port: set the port exported
    command: command run when service start running.
    environment: set environment variable.
    links: write a service to make connection

  postgres:
    image:
    volumes: write a path to export volume

  database:
    ima
    volumes_from: write a service to mount

    <h1>Runnning Application</h1>
    <p>Now you got ready to run the application.<br>
    you can run your application just by these two commands.
    </p>
    <pre> docker-compose build
    docker-compose up -d
    </pre>
    Accese http://localhost:3000/ and you can see the Hello Yesod home page if you did correctly did this instruction.

    <h1>what is the next?</h1>
    <p>
      I'll describe edit flow next time
